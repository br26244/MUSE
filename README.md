# MUSE: A virtual crate-digging app
>Author [Byron Rios](https://github.com/br26244)
## Project Description
Muse is a random music generator that selects a random song based on a given range of years, and genres. Muse intends to provide inspiration to music producers and artists by bringing the crate digging experience online.

## How it works
Simply select the genres you are interested in digging, the range of years you wish to look through, and hit generate; Muse will look through the vast collection of albums, singles and ep's from Discogs API, presenting it to you through youtube's google cloud API.
